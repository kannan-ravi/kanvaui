## Overview

Welcome to KanvaUI, a collection of free, standalone UI components. Built with TailwindCSS and ShadCN, these components feature optional, fluid animations powered by Motion.

## Getting Started

While KanvaUI is optimized for Next.js projects using TailwindCSS and ShadCN, the components are fully compatible with any React environment.

-   **Copy and Paste**: Simply select the component you need and copy the code directly into your project.

-   **Check Requirements**: Review the component documentation for required libraries (e.g., Motion) to ensure full functionality.

-   **Customize as Needed**: Use the default designs or easily modify styles and animations to align with your brand identity.
